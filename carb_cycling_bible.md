# The Shelby Starnes & Justin Harris Carb Cycling Bible
*Pure Methodology - No Modifications*

## **CORE PROVEN METHODOLOGY**

### **Fundamental Principle**
Carb cycling is "just a way to rotate calories" within the laws of thermodynamics. You consume high carbohydrate diet on some days and low to moderate carbohydrate diet on other days to manipulate glycogen storage and maximize fat loss while preserving muscle.

### **The Three-Day System**
- **Low Carb Days:** Fat burning days with minimal carbohydrates
- **Medium Carb Days:** Training days with moderate carbohydrates  
- **High Carb Days:** Glycogen refill and metabolic reset days

## **EXACT MACRO RATIOS (PROVEN FORMULAS)**

### **Males**
| Day Type | Carbohydrates | Protein | Fat |
|----------|---------------|---------|-----|
| **High Carb** | 2-3g per lb bodyweight | 1-1.25g per lb bodyweight | As low as possible |
| **Low/Medium Carb** | 0.5-1.5g per lb bodyweight | 1.25-1.5g per lb bodyweight | 0.15-0.35g per lb bodyweight |

### **Females** 
| Day Type | Carbohydrates | Protein | Fat |
|----------|---------------|---------|-----|
| **High Carb** | 0.9-1.0g per lb bodyweight | 0.75g per lb bodyweight | As low as possible |
| **Low/Medium Carb** | 0.2-0.5g per lb bodyweight | 0.9-1.0g per lb bodyweight | 0.1-0.2g per lb bodyweight |

### **Real Examples from Their Materials**
**250lb Male:**
- **High days:** 500-750g carbs, 250-375g protein, very low fat
- **Low/Medium days:** 125-375g carbs, 313-375g protein, 38-88g fat

**150lb Female:**
- **High days:** 135-150g carbs, 113g protein, very low fat  
- **Low/Medium days:** 30-75g carbs, 135-150g protein, 15-30g fat

---

## **MEAL TIMING AND FREQUENCY (PROVEN PROTOCOL)**

### **Universal Rules**
- **5-7 meals per day** spaced 2.5-3 hours apart
- **Divide protein evenly** across all meals every day
- **Never skip meals** - consistency is critical for blood sugar, metabolism, and amino acid turnover

### **Carb Distribution Rules**
- **High Carb Days:** Divide carbohydrates evenly across all meals
- **Low/Medium Days:** Carbs ONLY in first meal(s) of day + post-workout meal
- **All other meals on low/medium days:** Protein + fat + vegetables only

---

## **WEEKLY STRUCTURE (THEIR SYSTEM)**

### **For Fat Loss**
- **1-2 high carb days per week maximum**
- **5-6 low to moderate carb days**
- High carb days on hardest training sessions (legs, back)

### **For Muscle Gain (Off-Season)**
- **2-3 high carb days per week**
- High carb days on major muscle group training days
- More moderate carb days, fewer extremely low days

### **Day Assignment**
- **Low carb days:** Rest days and cardio days
- **Medium carb days:** Regular training days
- **High carb days:** Heaviest training sessions (legs, back, weak points)

---

## **GLYCOGEN DEPLETION STRATEGY (CORE MECHANISM)**

### **The Science They Teach**
- Enter high carb days in a glycogen-depleted state
- If you can store 1,000g glycogen and enter depleted by 500g, you can eat 1,000g+ carbs without storing fat
- Carbs get stored as muscle glycogen rather than fat when depleted

### **Practical Application**
- Use low/medium carb days to systematically deplete glycogen
- High carb days refill stores and prevent metabolic adaptation
- "Cheat thermodynamics" by manipulating where excess calories are stored

---

## **THEIR BIGGEST MISTAKES TO AVOID**

### **#1 Cardinal Sin: Keeping Carbs Too Low**
*"The biggest mistake is people keeping carbs too low. They think carb cycling means like you're doing a no carb diet. It'll be like on days I don't train I eat zero carbs, on days I do train I eat 100, but then once a week I carb up with 300 grams of carbs. That's not carbing up, that's just a low carb diet."*

**Real High Carb Examples:**
- Advanced practitioner: 250g carbs per meal = 1,550g per day
- Contest prep: 150g carbs × 6 meals = 900g per day while dieting

### **#2 Poor Nutrient Timing**
- Don't eat fats with carbs on high days
- Don't spread carbs throughout day on low carb days
- Don't eat carbs before bed on low/medium days

### **#3 Inconsistent Implementation**
- Skipping meals destroys the system
- Irregular timing disrupts metabolic benefits
- Not eating enough protein consistently

---

## **SPECIFIC MEAL EXAMPLES (FROM THEIR PLANS)**

### **High Carb Day Sample (250lb Male)**
**Meal 1:** 90g carbs + 40g protein
- 1 3/4 cup oats (dry) + 1 1/4 scoop whey protein

**Meal 2:** 90g carbs + 40g protein  
- 2 1/4 cups brown rice (cooked) + 5oz chicken breast

**Meal 4 (Post-workout):** 20g carbs + 28g protein
- 1/3 cup oats (dry) + 1 1/4 scoop whey protein

### **Low/Medium Carb Day Sample**
**Meal 5:** 28g protein + 8g fat + vegetables
- 3oz eye of round steak + 1 cup asparagus + 16 almonds

---

## **METABOLIC PRINCIPLES THEY TEACH**

### **High Carb Day Functions**
- Raise insulin levels and fill glycogen stores
- Keep metabolism burning efficiently  
- Prevent muscle catabolism
- Reset hunger hormones and thyroid function
- Provide psychological relief during dieting

### **Low Carb Day Functions**
- "Fat burning days" with low insulin
- Allow maximum fat oxidation while retaining muscle
- Create glycogen depletion for subsequent high day
- Restore insulin sensitivity

### **Medium Carb Day Functions**
- Provide energy for weight training
- Bridge between low and high days
- Maintain training performance without excess calories

---

## **THEIR TRAINING INTEGRATION**

### **High Carb Day Placement**
- Schedule for most demanding workouts
- Legs and back are ideal choices
- Place high carb day ON the training day (not day before)
- Goal: maximize glycogen storage and protein synthesis POST-workout

### **Cardio Protocol (Justin's Method)**
- 1 minute hard / 1 minute easy intervals
- Hard enough that you can barely recover in the 1-minute rest
- Stimulates appetite and improves work capacity
- Allows clients to eat more food and continue progressing

---

## **PROVEN SUPPLEMENT GUIDANCE**

### **What They Actually Recommend**
- **Digestive enzymes** with high carb meals
- **Sea salt** (not table salt) for sodium needs  
- **Whey protein** for meal convenience
- **Basic multivitamin/mineral support**

### **What They DON'T Emphasize**
- Complex supplement stacks
- Exotic fat burners or metabolism boosters
- Pre-workout dependencies (Justin actually discourages regular use)

---

## **THE "MEAT AND RICE" PHILOSOPHY**

### **Justin's Core Teaching**
*"90% of being a bodybuilder is meat and rice. Pick any workout you like, train moderately hard, and eat meat and rice until you're full every 3 hours for 10 years and you'll be 95% of the bodybuilder you could be."*

### **Simplicity Over Complexity**
- Consistency trumps perfection
- Don't overthink food choices - pick what you'll actually eat
- Focus on the big rocks: meal timing, protein targets, carb cycling
- Advanced techniques matter only when basics are mastered

---

## **THEIR ADJUSTMENT PRINCIPLES**

### **When Fat Loss Stalls**
- First reduce high carb day frequency
- Then lower calories on medium/low days
- Increase cardio on low carb days
- Consider diet breaks for metabolic reset

### **When Energy Crashes**
- Don't go too low on medium days
- Ensure adequate post-workout nutrition
- Check meal timing consistency
- May need brief diet break

### **When Training Suffers**
- Time carb meals closer to training
- Increase medium day carbs slightly  
- Ensure post-workout carbs are adequate
- Don't train fasted on low carb days
