    -- Allow access if plan_id matches and client email is verified
    -- This will be enforced at the application level
    true
  );

-- Clients can view their own progress
CREATE POLICY "Client view own progress" ON progress_tracking

-- ===== APPLICATION-LEVEL SECURITY =====
-- Note: Most security is handled at the application level
-- The policies above provide basic database-level protection
-- Application-level checks ensure:
-- 1. Admin access only via service role key
-- 2. Client access only with valid plan_id + email
-- 3. Webhook access only from authorized sources

-- ===== POLICY EXPLANATION =====
/*
The policies above provide a layered security approach:

1. **Database Level (RLS)**: Basic protection against direct database access
2. **Application Level**: Main security through custom authentication
3. **Service Role**: Admin operations bypass RLS for legitimate admin access

This setup allows:
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard full access (via service role)
- ‚úÖ MCP server full access (via service role)
- ‚úÖ Client meal plan access (application-level verification)
- ‚úÖ Webhook meal plan creation (application-level verification)
- ‚úÖ Public food database access (read-only)

The application handles the detailed access control:
- Admin sessions are validated in the Express server
- Client access requires plan_id + email verification
- Webhook access is validated by the webhook endpoint
